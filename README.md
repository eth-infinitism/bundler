# EIP4337 reference modules

## Bundler

A basic eip4337 "bundler"

- expose a node with a minimal RPC calls:
  - eth_sendUserOperation to send a user operation
  - eth_supportedEntryPoints to report the bundler's supported entry points
  - eth_chainId

### Usage: 
1. run `yarn && yarn preprocess`
2. start hardhat-node with `yarn hardhat-node` (or local `geth`)

In another Window:

3. deploy contracts with `yarn hardhat-deploy --network localhost`
4. run `yarn run bundler`
  so it will listen on port 3000


To run a simple test, do `yarn run runop --deployFactory --network localhost`

   The runop script:
   - deploys a wallet deployer (if not already there)
   - creates a random signer (owner for wallet)
   - determines the wallet address, and funds it
   - sends a transaction (which also creates the wallet)
   - sends another transaction, on this existing wallet
   - (uses account[0] or mnemonic file for funding, and creating deployer if needed)


NOTE: if running on a testnet, you need to supply the bundler (and runop) the network and mnemonic file, e.g.

`yarn run bundler --network localhost --mnemonic file.txt`
