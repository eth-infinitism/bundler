# EIP4337 reference modules

## Bundler

A basic eip4337 "bundler"

- expose a node with a minimal RPC calls:
  - eth_sendUserOperation to send a user operation
  - eth_supportedEntryPoints to report the bundler's supported entry points
  - eth_chainId

usage: 
1. start hardhat-node with `yarn hardhat-node` or geth
In another Window:
2. deploy contracts with `yarn hardhat deploy --network localhost`
3. run `yarn run bundler --network localhost --mnemonic file` 
  so it will listen on port 3000
4. to run a simple test, do `yarn run runop --deployDeployer --network localhost`
   The runop script:
   - deploys a wallet deployer (if not already there)
   - creates a random signer (owner for wallet)
   - determines the wallet address, and funds it
   - sends a transaction (which also creates the wallet)
   - sends another transaction, on this existing wallet
   - (uses account[0] or mnemonic file for funding, and creating deployer if needed)
